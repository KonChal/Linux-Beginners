How do I get into the editor mode now?

 (i) switches to insert mode before the current cursor position.
 (I) switches to insert mode at the beginning of the current line.
 (a) switches to insert mode after the current cursor position.
 (A) switches to insert mode at the end of the current line.

Exit and save:

 :w filename saves the file under filename. If the file already exists the specification of the file name is optional.
 :w! saves the file even if it is read-only, if possible.
 :wq saves the current file and exits the editor.
 :x saves the current file and exits the editor.
 ZZ saves the current file and exits the editor. The missing colon is not a typo!
 :q terminates the editor. Edited files must have been saved before.
 :q! terminates the vi even if files have not yet been saved. The changes to these files are lost.
