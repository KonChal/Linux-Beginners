If you want to do this on a test partition, use the following command (note: substitute the path to your test partition).

sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdb2 bs=1k seek=10 count=4k

Now we list all block devices (it needs elevated rights for this):

sudo lsblk

sudo dump2fs /dev/sde2 | grep uperblock (I write "uperblock" because I don't know if it's upper or lower case ;-)

sudo fsck /dev/sdb2 (We could try to repair the partition directly => BUT, we are looking for the superblocks)

sudo mkfs.ext4 -n /dev/sdb2 (ATTENTION: be sure to use -n!!!! without -n you create a new file system!!) => now we see the superblocks

sudo fsck -b 40961 /dev/sdb2 (after -b insert a superblock from above)

If the first superblock does not work use the next one.

sudo fsck /dev/sdb2
