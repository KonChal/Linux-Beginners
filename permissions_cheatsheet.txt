000 = --- = 0
001 = --x = 1
010 = -w- = 2
011 = -wx = 3
100 = r-- = 4
101 = r-x = 5
110 = rw- = 6
111 = rwx = 7

Now let's explain the columns with permissions.

drwxr-xr-x 2 tom tom 4096 Jan 2 09:23 Images
-rw-r--r-- 1 tom tom 25 Jan 5 14:29 File2

The first bit (-) stands for a file or the (d) stands for a folder. There are others for example (l) for link.

The permissions consist of 12 bits. We have here 9 bits for the permissions. The first 3
are for the owner, the next 3 for the group and the last 3 for the "world/others".

r stands for read
w stands for write
x is for execute (for a file this would be for example an executable script - to execute a script needs r-x)
x stands for execute (for a directory this means that you can change into the directory - because open/execute folder)
